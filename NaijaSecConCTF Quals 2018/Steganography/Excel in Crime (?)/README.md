**Category:** Steganography
**Points:** 90


## Problem

The cashier of Ororo Oil was not so fast to escape and this file was retrieved from the her USB. We believe this file has something fishy in it. Help us with the hidden message.

**File:**  protekt.xlsx

## Solution

An excel file was given.

The file appears to be legitimate after opening it and it contains a table.

The flag was found in a protected cell containg an image, the one with the flipped policy of *Uber* hackerone policy, the flag reads thus

```
the flag you seek is NSC{pR0TEkshUN_15_inVaL1D}
```

Hence, the flag is **NSC{pR0TEkshUN_15_inVaL1D}**.
