# Cameroon : Right in picture
**Category:** Steganography
**Points:** 50


## Problem

Since the manager had his phone seized, DPR knew that looking at the photograph, the story it is telling cannot be outside it.

**File:** wrong.jpg

## Solution

An image file was given and indeed the information given there was wrong :D

{Image Here}

The son resembles the neighbour instead of the father. We'll that seem we got a bastard ðŸ˜‚.

Viewing the image as a raw file in a text editor(I used TextEdit), a string was found at the end of the file:

```
the f#la_g y,o.u s'e-e_k i,s N.S.C,{vERy_S1Mply_h!DD3N}
```

This was indeed *Right in picture* as stated in the challenge title.

Hence, the flag is **NSC{vERy_S1Mply_h!DD3N}**.
