**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 50


## Problem

The audio file was intercepted while being transmitted from a remote location. It's up to you to find out what information is contained therein.

**File:**  Sounds from Wayback.wav

**Hint:**  Enclose flag in NSC{_ _}

## Solution
The audio file appears to be a morse code.

Then used this website, https://morsecode.scphillips.com/labs/audio-decoder-adaptive/ to decode it.

This was decoded to 

```
WAY TOO EASY
```
And yea! This was way too easy.

Hence the flag is **NSC{WAY_TOO_EASY}**.
